## Conditionals : 
<p>In any programming language conditionals have a great place for them.
Without conditionals it is not possible to take decision. There are three types of 
conditionals in java. They are *if/else*, *switch* and *ternary*. in java *if/else* conditional
can have multiple branches. When it needs to create multiple branch then the two keyword are comming together.
As an example we can write the *if/else* condition like below.
    <p> 
        if(condition) {
        <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doSomeThing;
        <br/>
        } else {
        <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doOtherThing;
        <br/>
        }
    </p>
